The easiest way to add ruby characters to your WordPress site.

== Description ==
#### What’s Rubi?
Ruby characters are small, annotative characters that are usually placed above logographic characters when writing languages with logographic characters such as Chinese, Japanese or Korean to show the pronunciation.

#### Why Ruby Characters?

Ruby may be used for different reasons:

* because the character is rare and the pronunciation unknown to many—personal name characters often fall into this category;
* because the character has more than one pronunciation, and the context is insufficient to determine which to use;
* because the intended readers of the text are still learning the language and are not expected to always know the * pronunciation and/or meaning of a term;
* because the author is using a nonstandard pronunciation for a character or a term

#### How does it work?
Adding ruby characters couldn't be easier. Just select your text. Click on the "Add Ruby Characters" button. Type your ruby characters and you're all done.

== Screenshots ==
1. Highlight you text. Set your ruby characters. All done.
